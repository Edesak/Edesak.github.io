        So here you are. I wanted to create this site a long time ago for myself. 
        Weird right? Why don't I use obsidian? It is much more private and easy to customize. 
        Well, another thing is I wanted to learn a bit of web development for my own sake. 
        For sure there will be some kind of test site where I test stuff. T
        here will be a resume or portfolio with some linux guide/learn/experience and whatever I choose after all it is my website so buckle up. 
        So why don't you use it as a blog? When new things arrive in your journey you could post about it. 
        Well here is the thing first of all I'm fucking lazy and the post would be once per year (if i manage to get myself to write down something) the second thing is if I'm writing something like expirience/guide about the linux i want you yes you to understand in big picture so you don't have it in multiple blogs and search where is the updated version of it and stuff. 
        If I encounter something new or I solve something I want to only edit the previous thing so you have the problem and the answer in this big pile of something (my thoughts maybe). 
        So yea.. I think that this style of writing isn't suitable for everyone (or someone) and is really demanding on focus and capabilities but it's the best way to express experience and at the same time sometimes get solutions for your questions or problems.
